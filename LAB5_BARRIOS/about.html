            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Jay Barrios</strong>. I grew up in a small town, where my passion for learning and creativity flourished.</p>

            <p>During my time at <strong>High School</strong>, I was actively involved in various extracurricular activities, including <strong>clubs, sports, or other interests</strong>. These experiences helped me develop strong leadership and teamwork skills.</p>
            
            <p>At home, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. We love <strong>activities you do together</strong>, which strengthens our bond. I also value the time I spend on hobbies as they provide a creative outlet and help me unwind after a busy day.</p>
            
            <p>These experiences have shaped who I am today, and I’m excited to see where my journey takes me next!</p>
